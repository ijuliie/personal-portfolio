# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Complete
|Day 1| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline | Complete
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Complete
|Day 4| MVP & Bug Fixes | Incomplete
|Day 5| Final Touches | Complete
|Day 6| Present | Incomplete


## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## Google Sheet

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix 



### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

-hamburger nav bar
-pull data from google sheet

#### PostMVP 
- hamburger nav bar
- pull data from google sheet
- transition effect for navbar
- navbar is active when scrolled to content of page
- scroll effect on nav links


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Background image banner | H | 2hrs | 2hrs | 2hrs |
| Hamburger nav bar | H | 2hrs | 1.5 hrs | 3.5 hrs |
| Animation on nav bar | H | 2hrs | 4 hrs | 6 hours |
| Pull data from google sheet| H | 1 hr | 2.5 hrs | 2.5 hrs | 
| Contact form | L | 1 hr | 2 hrs | 2 hr |
| Styling | L | 2hrs | 3 hrs | 3 hrs |
| Total | H | hrs| hrs | hrs |

## Additional Libraries


## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Issues and Resolutions
